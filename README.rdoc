= About

PleasedToTweetYou is designed to be used as a full-screen kiosk application at the entrance to a conference.  You can use it to gather contact information about your attendees.  If an attendee chooses to add their Twitter username, they will also be sent a direct message announcing their arrival. The app was first used at iPhoneDevCamp, and was later refined for use at BarCamp Austin III.
